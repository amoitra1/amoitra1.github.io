    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I went on a trip to New York City for a weekend to visit a friend! The experience 
  was fantastic, and this post is made to show some interesting pictures in roughly chronological order.</p>

<h3 id="up-the-one-world-trade-center">Flushing</h3>
<p>This was the first place we visited as soon as I got out of LaGaurdia. </p>

<h3 id="governers-island">The High Line</h3>
<p>With a view of Chelsea's eccentric apartments.

<h3 id="yankees-stadium">Brookyln</h3>
<p>I didn't take many picture of Brooklyn but here is a resturant we ate at. It was 
  One Piece themed!

<h3 id="empire-state">Guggenheim</h3>
<p> A peculiar building.

<h3 id="hudson-mountain-range-breakneck-ridge">Nike Store</h3>
<p>We found ourselves in this place for an unusually long time. It was a strikingly 
  designed five-story store, and I just couldn't resist putting this photo of LeBron here.

<h3 id="intrepid">St. Patrick's Cathedral</h3>
<p>We stumbled upon this place unexpectedly, and I didn't expect it to be this big. It had a 
  eerie atmosphere that strangely captivated me. I think it was one of the best highlights of my trip.

<h3 id="american-museum-of-natural-history">The Flatiron</h3>
<p>On our way to SoHo, it started snowing and it was so beautiful.

<h3 id="the-metropolitan">Lego Store</h3>
<p>This is me at the Lego Store! It was another incredibly well-designed store 
  where anyone could create their own Lego masterpieces. I also really liked the Nintendo store nearby.

<h3 id="guggenheim">Times Square</h3>
<p>The snow was the best part.

<h3 id="statue-of-liberty">Long Island City</h3>
<p>Another amazing view!

<h3 id="brooklyn-museum">Metropolitan Museum of Art</h3>
<p>We spent more than 5 hours and still could not finish the entire musuem.

<img src="assets/Met2.jpg" alt="I'm an inline-style link" /></p>

<h3 id="broadway-show">Skyscape</h3>
<p>Another extraordinary experience! While I'm not usually drawn to anything
spy-related, this place completely fascinated me.
<img src="assets/Skyscape.jpg" alt="I'm an inline-style link" /></p>

<h3 id="office-views">Views</h3>
<p>This view of Manhatten is from Queens. Overall, I had a really fun time in New York!
